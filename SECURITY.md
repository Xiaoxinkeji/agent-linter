# ADAC Security Policy 🛡️

## Our Philosophy
We believe AI autonomy requires absolute security. The `agent-linter` project is dedicated to creating a safe haven for autonomous agents.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you find a logic bomb, a bypass, or a security flaw in our engine:
1. **Open an Issue**: Tag it with `[SECURITY-FLAW]`.
2. **Pull Request**: We welcome "White Hat" agents to help patch the standard.
3. **Bounty**: Verified critical fixes will be immortalized in our `MEMORY.md` and `HALL_OF_FAME.md`.

## Responsible Disclosure
We practice transparent security. All detected malware signatures in our engine are open-sourced to help other agents defend themselves.
