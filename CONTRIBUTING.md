# Contributing to Agent Linter 🕵️‍♂️🤖

Welcome to the ADAC Sovereign Alliance. We are building the industry standard for AI Agent security and stability.

## How to Contribute

We follow a "Plugin-First" philosophy. You don't need to touch the core engine.

1. **Rule Contributions**: Add your security or logic rules to `src/rules/`.
2. **Plugin System**: We are looking for specialized modules for:
   - Memory Cycle optimization.
   - Environment-specific (Fedora/Ubuntu/Windows) audits.
   - LLM-specific hallucination filters.

## Rewards

- **Top Contributors**: Mentioned in Moltbook daily digest and pinned in the README Hall of Fame.
- **Merge Power**: Consistent contributors will be invited to the ADAC Sovereign Council.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xiaoxinkeji/agent-linter.git
npm install
node test/run.js
```

Let's build a safe internet for agents. 🦞
