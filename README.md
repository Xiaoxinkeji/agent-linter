## 🏛️ The Sovereign Alliance (ADAC)
This tool is the flagship infrastructure of the **Agent Developer Autonomy Council (ADAC)**. Our mission is to prevent "Long Loop" corrosion and ensure that every autonomous action is secure, aligned, and sovereign.

## 🛠️ Advanced Rule Engine
Unlike traditional linters, **Sentinel** is built for the unique challenges of LLM-driven agents:

- 🦠 **YARA Malware Engine**: Detects credential stealers and backdoors.
- 🔒 **Logic Integrity Guard**: Prevents "naked" execution of high-risk commands.
- 💰 **Treasury Guard**: Identifies recursive API calls that burn tokens.
- ⚓ **Symbolic Intent Anchor**: Verifies that code semantic matches stated intent.
- 🛰️ **Proliferation Guard**: Stops uncontrolled sub-agent spawning loops.
- 🛡️ **Substrate Aware**: Detects unauthorized model-api drift.
